        Without treatment, HIV damages your immune system. \n\n
        Your immune system is the part of your body that fights infection and protects you from getting sick. \n\n
        When your immune system is damaged you are more likely to get ill."

  utter_faq_HIV_vs_AIDS:
    - text: "HIV is not the same thing as AIDS. \n\n
        HIV is the virus that can get passed on to another person. \n\n
        AIDS is a state of sickness that occurs when your body’s immune system is so damaged by HIV, it can’t fight off infections. \n\n
        People who have AIDS will feel sick, whereas people with HIV might not notice anything is wrong. \n\n
        Without treatment AIDS can lead to death. \n\n
        Today, antiretroviral treatment is so good, people living with HIV can live a normal productive life and never feel sick as long as they take their medication regularly."
  utter_faq_HIV_cure:
    - text: "There is no cure for HIV, although antiretroviral treatment can control the virus, meaning that people with HIV can live long and healthy lives. \n\n
        Most research is looking for a functional cure where HIV is reduced to undetectable and harmless levels in the body permanently, but some residual virus may remain. \n\n
        Other research is looking for a sterilising cure where HIV is eradicated from the body completely, but this is more complex and risky. \n\n
        Trials of HIV vaccines are encouraging, but so far offer only partial protection. \n\n
        Treatment is the only way to manage HIV and prevent it from damaging your immune system. It also reduces the risk of passing HIV on to your sexual partners."
  utter_faq_HIV_fatal:
    - text: "It is true that people who do not receive treatment for HIV will eventually (over years) become ill and die of complications of HIV infection. \n\n
        With effective treatment (called antiretroviral therapy), however, most people with HIV infection will lead long and healthy lives; this is especially true if they start HIV treatment when their immune system is still relatively strong."
